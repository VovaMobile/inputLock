# Input Lock
Version 1.0

## Introduction

Do you have kids or pets at home? Do you have a cat and It likes very much climbing your table and walking over your keyboard? Then Input Lock is for you! You will be able to leave your computer alone and turned on without risk.

Once installed, you will be able to lock your keyboard and touch screen, if your laptop has one. Unfortunately, mouse can't yet be locked.

## Usage

This addon adds an extra gesture to NVDA. By default it's NVDA+k, but it can (and should) be changed from Input gestures dialog. Read the NVDA User Guide for more information.

When you press that gesture, NVDA will say "Input locked". Your keyboard and touch screen will be blocked until you press the same gesture again. In that moment, NVDA will say "Input unlocked" and everything will work as usual.

## Limitations

Input Lock has the following limitations:

* Mouse can't be locked.
* The shortcut ctrl+alt+del can be used even with the keyboard is locked.
